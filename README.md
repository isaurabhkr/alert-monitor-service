# Alerting and Monitoring Service

## Solution:

Based on the problem statement, we need to design and implement a system to capture events generated by any system or user-triggered and raise an alert according to alert configuration.

## Design:

We can break down the problem into the following components:

    Event Generator: It will generate events based on user interactions or system events.

    Monitoring Service: It will listen to the events generated by the Event Generator and monitor them based on the alert configuration.

    Alerting Service: It will dispatch the alerts based on the dispatch strategy.

    Dispatch Strategy: It defines the dispatch mechanism, such as sending an email, SMS, or logging the alert message.

    Alert Configuration: It defines the alert configuration, such as count, window size, and dispatch strategy.

## Requirements
 * Java 17
 * Maven
 
## Using the API
Simply start the app and make a HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8080/health and you will get a JSON response if app is UP.

## Sample Client Configuration
```
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.eventType=PAYMENT_EXCEPTION
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.alertType=SLIDING_WINDOW
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.alertCount=3
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.alertWindowSize=10

client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.dispatchStrategy.type[0]=EMAIL
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.dispatchStrategy.message[0]=payment exception threshold breached
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.dispatchStrategy.subject[0]=payment exception threshold breached

client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.dispatchStrategy.type[1]=CONSOLE
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.dispatchStrategy.message[1]=issue in payment
client.client1.PAYMENT_EXCEPTION.dispatchStrategy.subject[1]=issue in payment
```
