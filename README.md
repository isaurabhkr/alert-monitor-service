# Alerting and Monitoring Service

## Solution:

Based on the problem statement, we need to design and implement a system to capture events generated by any system or user-triggered and raise an alert according to alert configuration.

## Design:

We can break down the problem into the following components:

    Event Generator: It will generate events based on user interactions or system events.

    Monitoring Service: It will listen to the events generated by the Event Generator and monitor them based on the alert configuration.

    Alerting Service: It will dispatch the alerts based on the dispatch strategy.

    Dispatch Strategy: It defines the dispatch mechanism, such as sending an email, SMS, or logging the alert message.

    Alert Configuration: It defines the alert configuration, such as count, window size, and dispatch strategy.

## Requirements
 * Java 17
